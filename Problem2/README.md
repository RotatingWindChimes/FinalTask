# Description

Two experiments are included in this program: ViT model and an additional experiment.

# Experiment

* Run ```main.py``` to train the ViT model from beginning. Training results (except model parameters), such as loss values will be stored in __logs__. Model Parameters will be stored in __save__. 
* Run ```pretrin.py``` to train the additional experiment.

# Test
* Run ```test.py``` to test the selected model.

# Remark
* If you want to run the additional experiment, please download the pre-trained parameters from [Pre-trained](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1yLwc42mSk_sA8jd8PArALw?pwd=81w3) and place them under __vit-base-patch16-224-in21k__.
* If you want to test the model without training, please download the model parameters from [Parameters](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1o9UXkilCQ1T_QNP83l8_tA?pwd=2b3q) and place it under __save__.
